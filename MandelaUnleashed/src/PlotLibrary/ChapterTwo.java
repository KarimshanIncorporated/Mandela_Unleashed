Furthermore, were not allowed to wear sunglasses which caused the brightness to inflict irreversible damage upon your eyes. ";

        ch2[12] ="Many nations in Africa and across the world stop investing in South Africa. The banks stop lending and aiding their financial crisis and put more pressure on the government for the sake of your release.
