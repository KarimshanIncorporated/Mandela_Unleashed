        ch1[13] = "Five years pass, and the apartheid rages on in Africa. Now things started getting heated up and you and the ANC need to get the word out there.

        ch1[26] = "That is a shame. You might have grown up to be a significant man. But now, you chose to do something as insignificant as this. You will never grow up to be the leading man you were destined to be, and you will live your life, fading away into the obscurity of the everyday people who do not try to leave their mark. No one listens to you, and everyone who once looked up to you loses their respect";
        ch1[27] = "Days later, people have already begun to start rumors of how you’ve already abandoned the true African way. The ANCYL slowly loses power as dissent increases and members take sides. Your weak choices have led to the dissolution of the African National Congress. Soon, the government quietly arrests those who were involved in the ANC and the public looks away as you are locked away.";
        ch1[28] = "The ANC stay quiet as the elections finish and the new reforms are put into place. At this point in time, the ANC has been trampled on and destroyed. Whenever you tried to raise your voice, the National Party silenced you easily. The ANC is no more, and your mission has failed.";

        ch1[32] = "The ANC and you are arrested, searched and beaten. All sorts of insults were thrown as they were beaten and taken away. You on the other hand, stand next to Sisulu, watching your brethren get beaten as the white captain walks to you and presses the gun to your faces. “We don’t have time for you, and the world doesn’t have time for you.” With one click of the silver, you both fall upon your death beds, leaving behind no legacy and destroying the ANC.";
        ch1[33] = "Sometime passes as the ANC stand by idly everyday, continuing their original intentions. Boycotting and strikes were becoming easier to deal with by the government, by beating and threats of arrest to the doers. You stand watching and trying as much as you can to stop the apartheid, but your voice barely reaches a soul. Soon the ANC is enveloped by the corruption of the nationalists and they lose all trace of what work they tried to accomplish.";
        ch1[34] = "The government was done dealing with troublesome pests. As the protests across the nation grew, they ran out of ways to deal with this peacefully. They are tired and done with the actions executed by the ANC, and since the ANC won't simply listen, they decided that they will end it. ";
        ch1[35] = "Across the nation, those who did not submit were shot down and killed. With no means of protection, the ANC crumbled down.
